        	<div class="collapsible-body">
						<p class="flow-text">Hi, I’m Haley, and I have an eating disorder.</br> </br> But first, let me catch you up… </br>
        </br> I would say that I grew up pretty “normal”, whatever normal means. I was always encouraged to be myself, even if it
        wasn’t what my parents thought I would turn out like. I was always told how beautiful I was (even in my awful “punk rock”
        hair days. Ha!); I was never forced to diet, never told I was ugly, or never made to feel bad about myself. I was also raised to know
        and believe that God made me in His image, and that made me wonderful. The only flaw in my history would be the fact I come
         from a long line of family members who suffer from severe anxiety, which in a later post I will explain how that is the
         core of my eating disorder.</br></br>So see, I don’t have a tragic past leading up to my poor body image. Disappointed yet?
       </br></br>When I was 19ish,  I was given the opportunity to have my 15 minutes of fame and be on an episode of a TV show. As
       a 19 year old, I thought I was on my way to fame and fortune. I had always wanted to be a model, and even highly considered
       trying out for America’s Next Top Model. As I was on set for this show, I was talking to one of the ladies running things. She
       had told me stories of working with certain modeling celebrities, so I confided in her my dream to model. LIFE TURNING EVENT
       AHEAD ----> Her words to me were, “Don’t take this the wrong way, you are beautiful, but if you’re not X pounds, they won’t use
       you.” </br> </br> What? </br> </br> I worked out, I was a fighter at the time, so I was in shape, had a little muscle, etc. I
       had always been called “tall and lanky”. I was healthy (ok, ok, minus my obsession with Taco Bell, which is not healthy, if you
        were wondering).</br></br>Fine. Whatever. She didn’t get to tell me I couldn’t model. I was beautiful, right? ANTM or modeling
        agencies would still want me.</br></br>Fast forward a year, and I met my husband. (Note, I’ve ditched the modeling dream, not
        the lifestyle I desire anymore.) Things moved faster than a normal relationship since we were doing long distance. So when I
        was 20, like all brides-to-be, I started  getting “wedding dress ready”. I was going to look AMAZING in my dress.</br></br>What
        was my goal? Somewhere, deep down where I had hidden those words that Mrs. I’ve Worked With Models told me,  I made my goal to
        be X pounds.</br></br>So I started… I downloaded a calorie counting app, moved my mom’s scale to my bathroom, I read tons of
        “healthy”, “Top 10 Ways to Lose Weight”, and “thinspo” posts. I was determined, and if you know me as a person, when I want
        something, I work my ass off to get it.</br></br>It seemed SO innocent to me. But in my head, I twisted “healthy eating” into
        “restricting”. Calories and scale numbers were becoming a way of life. I was headed down a dark path, and it got way worse
        before it even started to get better… </br></br> It’s so crazy to write all this out now, reliving how it all fell into place.
        As a teen, I was so confident, and with a simple (yeah, clearly not so simple) comment and dealing with anxiety that I didn’t
        know I even had yet, I was triggered into years of self destruction. After 6 years, I’ve decided to finally talk about my journey,
        in hopes to help others who may be struggling with their own self love.</br></br>My next post will go deeper into what living with
        an eating disorder is like- trust me, it isn’t going to be glamorous.</br></br>

      <div class="collapsible-body">
				<p class="flow-text">	I’ve put this post off for long enough.<br/><br/>It’s just, once I post this, people know. People know what I’ve done to my body, how I
					abused and neglected it. Some will say I’m posting this for attention. Some will say that I don’t have to tell everything, keep it a secret. But that’s just
					it, I don’t want it to be a secret. I want people to understand that an eating disorder isn’t just a “I want to be skinny” issue. It’s more that just “being
					skinny”, in fact, most of it isn’t even about being skinny. For me, it was about control. When my diagnosed severe anxiety kicked in, and I felt I had zero
					control in my life, I knew I could control the number on the scale, control the number on the size of my pants, control what I put into my body. <br/><br/>It
					all started innocent, as most tragedies do. I wanted to have the perfect bridal body for my wedding. Restricting my food intake slightly, just more conscious
					of what was going in my body, and 1-2 workouts a day. No big deal. (Remember from my first post, Mrs. YouHaveToBeXXXPoundsToModel had told me if I wasn’t XXX
					pounds, no one would let me model, so that subconsciously became my goal.)<br/><br/>I got married, moved 11 hours away from home, started living with another
					human, started a new job, had no friends… blah blah blah. Though all GOOD changes, ones I would NEVER take back, they were still overwhelming changes and it
					took a toll on me mentally. I started telling myself I was going to “get fit”, “get in shape”, whatever other lie that resembled those. I religiously looked
					up dieting techniques, “healthy” meal plans, new workouts. <br/><br/>I started comparing my womanly body to those of high schoolers or models who are PAID to
					 workout and eat properly 24/7. Yes, I compared my 21 year old body to that of 16-18 year olds, thinking I was huge if I didn’t look like them.<br/><br/>Can
					 we clear one thing? I’m 5’10”. Not even in my “prime” high school days did my tall body look like that. I was an athlete, sparring and fighting were my sports.
					  I had to be strong to do those things. <br/><br/>I started restricting my food intake. It’s quite sad looking back, but let me give you a look into a day of
						food for someone struggling with anorexia with bulimic tendencies:<br/><br/>Breakfast: Coffee and MAYBE a slice of toast or 2 eggs if I was ok with the number
						 on the scale that morning<br/><br/>
	Lunch: Salad with just veggies, or grilled chicken and veggies and rice (in super small proportions. Remember, I had to look like I didn’t have a problem… I was just “getting healthy”.)<br/><br/>
	Dinner: Steamed carrots, green beans, and a few tomato slices (If I was eating in front of someone, I’d eat good and feel so guilty later, or just eat small proportions and say I wasn’t that hungry)
	<br/><br/>I would skip meals if I could get away with it.<br/><br/>I worked out too much. I pushed my weak body to limits that no one with an eating disorder should. But I had to “burn calories”, I
	had to beat the girl at the gym who was at the unhealthy weight that I wanted to be at. I literally would go and hate myself the whole time she was there because I didn’t look like her. I’m surprised
	 I never passed out and fell on a treadmill, to be honest with you. I felt like I should have on many occasions. <br/><br/>Sometimes though, I would get “weak” and crave more food, so I would do this
	  terrible thing where I would binge. Binging to me though wasn’t 5,000+ calories, binging to me was about 500 calories. Crazy, right? A normal meal is to be around 500 calories. So, want to know the
		 ugly part of binge eating? Here you go: <br/><br/> I remember binge eating once, and I ate almost a whole pack of blueberry bagels, but I was just pulling out most of the blueberries, and tossing
		 the rest on the top of the trash can. I was still immensely starving, so I started pulling the other pieces of bagel off the top of the trash and eating them. So gross, right? I know. I was starving,
		  and quite frankly, didn’t care in that moment. I just wanted to feel full. <br/><br/>There was about a month there that I was trying to puke after I ate. “I just wanted relief because my stomach hurt
			 after eating.” I remember specifically one time where I ate two eggs with sriracha on them. I actually felt guilty for even eating anything at all, so I went and shoved a toothbrush down my throat to
			  puke it all back up. My eyes red, tears rolling down my face, my face red, egg now in my nose, and the worst burn from the siracha. Needless to say, I’m not a fan of sriracha anymore. Ha. Those times
				 spent hovering over a toilet weren’t my favorite, as I’ve always despised puking, like I remember crying as a kid if I thought I was even going to throw up. After a month of this, I found that just
				  not eating “worked better” for me. <br/><br/>That’s when I also picked up the laxative addiction. Do you know what it is like taking a normal dose of laxatives? A normal dose is 1-3, ya know, to
					get your bowels moving. I got up to taking 9 laxatives, folks. In other words, I was shitting my brains out. I’m talking that if I was out in public, it didn’t matter, because if the urge hit,
					I better get somewhere fast or I would have shit my pants (which I never did, thank God!). It was miserable, dehydrating, and it just made you feel like……. shit. I started this because I wanted to
					 get rid of excess water weight, and what better way than to dehydrate yourself ( said my Eating Disorder)? Fun fact, taking that many can also do the opposite and make you bloat severely, which
					  in turn makes you starve yourself more. <br/><br/>Let’s discuss another ugly part of this: being a Type 1 Diabetic. When your blood sugars are high, you start to lose weight, because with
						constant highs, your body starts to eat the fat in your body (there is more science to this, but you get my point). So if my blood sugars were high, I didn’t care. I was losing weight, and
						 I was constantly peeing from the high sugars, so it meant more water weight gone. <br/><br/>Laxative abuse, high blood sugars, and nowhere near enough food in my body. Let me tell you what
						  that does to your body:<br/><br/>I couldn’t walk from the back of the salon I worked at to my station (about 10-15 steps) without feeling like I was going to pass out. Insomnia became a
							normal night time battle. My heart would race like I ran a marathon with only a few steps taken. I constantly had to go sit down due to lightheadedness. I became weak, not being able to
							workout as much as I wanted to. I had no energy. It started showing because I stopped caring about taking care of myself. Buns and sweatshirts were a normal attire for me, I just didn’t
							care anymore. <br/><br/>The saddest part is, once I hit the weight that Mrs. YouHaveToBexxxPoundsToModel told me I would have to be at, it was too late. It was a game for me, now. Every
							morning I woke up, peed, then weighed myself. If I hadn’t dropped since the day before, well, I had to starve more that day. I kept going down, down, down. And each day, as I got lower
							and lower than what a normal weight should be, I still looked in the mirror and genuinely hated what I saw. No matter what I weighed, I could never find myself to be pretty or skinny.
							<br/><br/>That’s the point people, it doesn’t actually matter what someone with an eating disorder weighs, because they are NEVER happy with themselves. <br/><br/>If you know me, you
							know I have the biggest heart, and one of the hardest times was when a lady I worked with looked at me and said, “I’m so tired of you talking about diets and getting healthy. If you
							think you are fat, what do you think about me?” This lady struggled with health issues that led to weight gain. I was broken. She had no idea that I struggled with an eating disorder,
							 she had no idea that I didn’t even notice her weight. I never REALLY looked at other people, unless I was in a comparing mode to the high schoolers, because an eating disorder is
							 somewhat selfish, in the sense that I only cared about myself, my figure, my weight. If she only knew how I wish I had the confidence to not worry about my weight, if she only knew
							  how I wish I could be happy with myself. But I mumbled something to her and tried hard not to talk about diets or exercise in front of her again. I would never want someone to feel
								 that I thought so bad of them due to their weight. I still get sick thinking of that moment. <br/><br/>I’m not saying in these years that I didn’t have good times. All the dark
								 parts were mostly my burden to bear. I didn’t want people to see me struggle, I didn’t want people to feel sorry for me, and I didn’t want anyone to bear these burdens with me.
								 I was so embarrassed! In fact, many didn’t know I was struggling until I told them. I’m good at keeping a smile on my poker face. <br/><br/>Aghhhhh. If you got through this, thank
								 you. Thanks for letting me spill my heart out. Thanks for letting me show you into the life of one with an eating disorder. My next post will be lighter, into recovery, but I needed
								  people to know the darkest parts first, so that way the end is MUCH sweeter.
