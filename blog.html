        <div class="collapsible-body"><p class="flow-text">Hi, I’m Haley, and I have an eating disorder.</br> </br> But first, let me catch you up… </br>
        </br> I would say that I grew up pretty “normal”, whatever normal means. I was always encouraged to be myself, even if it
        wasn’t what my parents thought I would turn out like. I was always told how beautiful I was (even in my awful “punk rock”
        hair days. Ha!); I was never forced to diet, never told I was ugly, or never made to feel bad about myself. I was also raised to know
        and believe that God made me in His image, and that made me wonderful. The only flaw in my history would be the fact I come
         from a long line of family members who suffer from severe anxiety, which in a later post I will explain how that is the
         core of my eating disorder.</br></br>So see, I don’t have a tragic past leading up to my poor body image. Disappointed yet?
       </br></br>When I was 19ish,  I was given the opportunity to have my 15 minutes of fame and be on an episode of a TV show. As
       a 19 year old, I thought I was on my way to fame and fortune. I had always wanted to be a model, and even highly considered
       trying out for America’s Next Top Model. As I was on set for this show, I was talking to one of the ladies running things. She
       had told me stories of working with certain modeling celebrities, so I confided in her my dream to model. LIFE TURNING EVENT
       AHEAD ----> Her words to me were, “Don’t take this the wrong way, you are beautiful, but if you’re not X pounds, they won’t use
       you.” </br> </br> What? </br> </br> I worked out, I was a fighter at the time, so I was in shape, had a little muscle, etc. I
       had always been called “tall and lanky”. I was healthy (ok, ok, minus my obsession with Taco Bell, which is not healthy, if you
        were wondering).</br></br>Fine. Whatever. She didn’t get to tell me I couldn’t model. I was beautiful, right? ANTM or modeling
        agencies would still want me.</br></br>Fast forward a year, and I met my husband. (Note, I’ve ditched the modeling dream, not
        the lifestyle I desire anymore.) Things moved faster than a normal relationship since we were doing long distance. So when I
        was 20, like all brides-to-be, I started  getting “wedding dress ready”. I was going to look AMAZING in my dress.</br></br>What
        was my goal? Somewhere, deep down where I had hidden those words that Mrs. I’ve Worked With Models told me,  I made my goal to
        be X pounds.</br></br>So I started… I downloaded a calorie counting app, moved my mom’s scale to my bathroom, I read tons of
        “healthy”, “Top 10 Ways to Lose Weight”, and “thinspo” posts. I was determined, and if you know me as a person, when I want
        something, I work my ass off to get it.</br></br>It seemed SO innocent to me. But in my head, I twisted “healthy eating” into
        “restricting”. Calories and scale numbers were becoming a way of life. I was headed down a dark path, and it got way worse
        before it even started to get better… </br></br> It’s so crazy to write all this out now, reliving how it all fell into place.
        As a teen, I was so confident, and with a simple (yeah, clearly not so simple) comment and dealing with anxiety that I didn’t
        know I even had yet, I was triggered into years of self destruction. After 6 years, I’ve decided to finally talk about my journey,
        in hopes to help others who may be struggling with their own self love.</br></br>My next post will go deeper into what living with
        an eating disorder is like- trust me, it isn’t going to be glamorous.</br></br>
